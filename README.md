# SpaceNet

SpaceNet is a software platform for simulation and analysis of space exploration campaign logistics.

## Project Structure

The `app/` directory contains SpaceNet web applications. The `database` application provides an editor for a database of common space exploration components such as network locations, resource types, and exploration elements. The `campaign` application constructs and analyzes space exploration campaigns.

The `spacenet/` directory contains Python library functions to define SpaceNet objects and corresponding simulation and analysis routines.
